In my Cross Country team, there is a yearly tradition of doing a rock-paper-scissors tournament, just for fun. Since we were all competitive people, obviously rock-paper-scissors was serious business, and we all tried our hardest to win. In the end, I was the one that managed to end up on top, and to be honest I didn't follow much of a strategy, so I don't feel I deserved the win. In this paper, I hope to both understand the human psyche through statistics as well as conquer my imposter syndrome by seeing what patterns emerge when people play rock-paper-scissors, and what that can teach us about the optimal strategy to beat the rest of your cross Country teammates in a kid's game.

the data from my paper proves my hypothesis incorrect; indeed, rock was the most popular play, even in the highest level of rock-paper-scisors play. there are two reasons i can guess <awkward phrasing>. The more likely option is that, under the pressure of winning fifty-thousand dollars or a Toyota <carname>, people simply reverted back to playing what was natural for them, even if they had the statistic in their head that people usually played rock. the second possible reason is that once more people started playing paper to counter the rock, scissors became popular to counter the paper, and then the play became rock to counter scissors. the cyclic nature of the game makes it hard to understand which one it is. it's likely a mix of both reasons. either way, my hypothesis is didsproven. <add bit somewhere about studying more tourney to understand if it's cyclic or not>
